# NODE.js Express News Portal API

This is a training project. <br>
The main idea of the project - create API and later use it
for create an interface using React and Vue frameworks 
in conjunction with a full-fledged API.

At the heart of the project used `Express`. <br>
`Prism` was used to interact with the database. <br>
`Nodemon` and a few auxiliary libraries are integrated. <br>
And, of course, the `TypeScript`)


### For installation use command

```
